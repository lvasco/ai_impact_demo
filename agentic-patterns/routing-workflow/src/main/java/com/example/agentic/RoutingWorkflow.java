/**
 * Implements the Routing workflow pattern that classifies input and directs it
 * to specialized
 * followup tasks. This workflow enables separation of concerns by routing
 * different types
 * of inputs to specialized prompts and processes optimized for specific
 * categories.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The routing workflow is particularly effective for complex tasks where:
 * <ul>
 * <li>There are distinct categories of input that are better handled
 * separately</li>
 * <li>Classification can be handled accurately by an LLM or traditional
 * classification model</li>
 * <li>Different types of input require different specialized processing or
 * expertise</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Common use cases include:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Customer support systems routing different types of queries (billing,
 * technical, etc.)</li>
 * <li>Content moderation systems routing content to appropriate review
 * processes</li>
 * <li>Query optimization by routing simple/complex questions to different model
 * capabilities</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This implementation allows for dynamic routing based on content
 * classification,
 * with each route having its own specialized prompt optimized for specific
 * types of input.
 * 
 * <p/>
 * Implementation uses the <a href=
 * "https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/1.0/api/structured-output-converter.html">Spring
 * AI Structure Output</a> to convert the chat client response into a structured
 * {@link RoutingResponse} object.
